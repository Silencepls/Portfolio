# Portfolio
#### Description:
Hello, my name is Vin√≠cius Torres (silence please), 19 years old, with Brazilian and European nationality, currently living in Brazil, Pernambuco. This project is a summary of my entire journey of studies and projects with computer science.

My goal with this portfolio is to provide a more human look at who I am, my story, personality, and also to show all the projects I've done so far.

Here you are going to find a little bit of my story, career, which include projects in game development, digital illustration, web development, marketing and computer science. I also present a list of my strong points, my certificates and how you can contact me.

In this public project, made also to be my final project of the cs50, I used html, with fontsawasome; some css to style the page and make it look better, and some javascript: the main.js, with the purpose of adding simple logics to image buttons, so you can click them to see the next or previous image; and the translator.js with the purpose of adding the ability to translate the page to english and portuguese. I chose to make a simple dictonary and directly translate every text, so I could make sure it would stay concise with the original essays I wrote in portuguese.

Right now I am looking for job opportunities while I finish my studies in computer science. Despite being in a tough financial situation, I am focused on completing this portfolio, earning my CS50 certificate from Harvard and starting to apply for jobs.

Upon completion of this project, I intend to continue developing my skills through reading and personal projects, with plans to incorporate technologies such as cloud, node and express into a dynamic website as my next challenge.

I believe that this portfolio and my life trajectory can attract the attention of potential employers and give me opportunities for interviews and, thus, eventually gain a position in the job market. I look forward to applying my knowledge and skills in a professional environment and continuing to grow in my career.
